# ssh_tunnels
How to create and use SSH Tunnels with Toad, SQLDeveloper, SQL*PLus etc. Uses Putty, MobaXterm and BitVise SSH clients to create the tunnels.

The latest version of this document can always be found at https://github.com/NormanDunbar/ssh_tunnels/releases.

This is a quick document I worte to show how easy it is to set up an SSH Tunnel between a desktop computer, an SSH server and some database servers. The latter, of course, must be accessible from the SSH server or the whole process doesan't work!

This tunnelling can be used to allow you, for example, to access databases on a remote/cloud server that requires you to log in to an intermediary SSH server in order to access them. Setting up a tunnel allows you to connect with your favourite DBA tools which might not be installed on the intermediary SSH server.

Enjoy.
